# simple-math-game

The idea behind this is to have a simple command line based math game where users are asked a series of baisic math questions.

A user can select what series of questions they would like to be asked, e.g. addition, subtration, multiplication or division. They can also specify the number of questions they would like to be asked (min. 10 questions).
